                                Facebook account usually contains their full name, email address, birthday, and probably
                                several
                                pictures of them. All that data was given knowingly by the user. But what about data
                                that you don’t
                                give directly and how is it used? A lot of our rights are signed away when we agree to
                                those
                                lengthy, unreadable “Terms of Use” statements and often these agreements include selling
                                your data
                                to third parties to which the original company whose application you are using holds no
                                responsibility over. When the internet first began to flourish, data such as how fast a
                                user types
                                and the types of spelling errors they make were viewed as a useless surplus of
                                information, but
                                nowadays that kind of information is valuable and used to create user models like the
                                look-alike
                                models we discuss below. In this section, we’ll cover just a few important data

                                will experience
                                at least one instance of hacking into one of our accounts - whether it’s banking
                                information, an
                                email account, or social media profile. In this section we have broken down privacy into
                                two
                                categories - basic and advanced. Basic privacy protocols are things everyone should be
                                doing. More
                                advanced protocols are for those who are interested in being more anonymous than the
                                average user.
                                It’s important to note that the more privacy protocols you enact, the less convenient it
                                might be to
                                use various apps, websites, and devices. The balance between privacy and convenience is
                                something
                                that everyone must decide for themselves.</p></li>

                                it was blogs,
                                then MySpace, and now Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and countless others. There are
                                wonderful
                                aspects to social media. We can connect to our loved ones around the world and stay
                                updated on what
                                and how they’re doing. We can meet other like minded people who have the same interests
                                as us.
                                Nowadays, a lot of people use it for news and entertainment. Social media is not as
                                innocuous as it
                                may seem on the surface, though, and we must protect ourselves from the dangers of it
                                the best we
                                can.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Edward Snowden is a crucial figure to know in regards to our personal privacy. In
                                2013, he blew the
                                whistle on the unorthodox and invasive procedures performed by the CIA during his
                                employment with
                                them. These procedures and allowances were highly intrusive to the personal privacy of
                                all
                                Americans. After the September 11th attacks in 2001, Congress was quick to pass The
                                Patriot Act
                                which allowed them to essentially spy on us without much or any evidence at all. It’s
                                safe to say
                                most of us were under the impression that in order for government agencies to access
                                things like our
                                personal phone calls, proper protocol involving judicial approval must be followed.
                                Unfortunately,
                                under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the government was collecting information on the
                                phone calls
                                of millions of Americans without the need for due process. This section of the Patriot
                                Act was ruled
                                unconstitutional in 2015 thanks to Snowden’s actions, but unrestricted access to our
                                personal
                                information by our own government is still under threat.</p></li>

                                Boston,
                                Massachusetts. She is the author of the book <i>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The
                                    Fight for a
                                    Human Future at the New Frontier of Power</i> published in 2019. In her book, she
                                details the
                                concept of
                                “surveillance capitalism” where users and their data are a commodity that is bought and
                                sold by
                                corporations, essentially using us as currency rather than consumers. Surveillance
                                capitalism occurs
                                at a level we don’t have access to. For example, the New York Times published an article
                                about how
                                Target was able to predict that a teenage girl was pregnant by tracking her behavior
                                online and
                                subsequently sent her advertisements for baby related items. This specific event has
                                been disputed,
                                but the concept is frighteningly real.</p></li>

                            <li><p>The term “information literacy” refers to the ability of the reader to analyze the
                                information they
                                are reading and determine whether that information is relevant and reliable. Many of us
                                can recall
                                learning about creating “works cited” pages and using proper citations and references
                                for research
                                papers we wrote in school. Turns out, that skill extends far beyond just writing
                                academic papers. In
                                a perfect world, news media sources would all be held accountable for providing accurate
                                and current
                                information. Sadly, this is not the reality we live in. Most news media sources have
                                their own
                                agendas, from pushing products of the corporations who sponsor them to skewing news
                                stories to alter
                                our perceptions of events. A fun way to remember how to evaluate sources, whether it’s
                                printed, on
                                the web, or on TV, is to ask yourself, “Is it CRAP?” The acronym CRAP stands for
                                Currency,
                                Relevance/Reliability, Authority, and Purpose.</p></li>
