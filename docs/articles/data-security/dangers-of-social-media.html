                    Social media has been around in various forms since the dawn of the internet. First it was blogs,
                    then MySpace, and now Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and countless others. There are wonderful
                    aspects to social media. We can connect to our loved ones around the world and stay updated on what
                    and how they’re doing. We can meet other like minded people who have the same interests as us.
                    Nowadays, a lot of people use it for news and entertainment. Social media is not as innocuous as it
                    may seem on the surface, though, and we must protect ourselves from the dangers of it the best we
                    can.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, let’s take a look at what we usually post on our social media accounts. We share personal
                    photos, birthdates, our location, and place of work. All of this information isn’t just stored on
                    your profile, it’s also collected and kept by the social media platform to be used and sold for
                    advertising. At the very least, we are making ourselves vulnerable to stalkers and hackers who have
                    nefarious intentions. Unfortunately, the danger of individual predators hardly scratches the surface
                    of how your social media profile can be used and abused by various corporations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you were active on Facebook during the US 2016 elections, you might have heard the phrase “echo
                    chamber” being circulated. Facebook analyzes what each user interacts with the most, whether it’s
                    comments, likes, or shares, and sells that information to various sources to target you and direct
                    your behavior on the internet. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal came about when it was
                    discovered that Facebook was selling our information to the British company Cambridge Analytica so
                    that they could use it to push conservative-leaning agendas in the United States through the social
                    media platform. Cambridge Analytica’s analysis of the data they bought from Facebook about us was so
                    in depth that they were able to manipulate people using their fear, anger, and paranoia. This
                    manipulation did not stop at online behavior - they were affecting how people emotionally reacted to
                    certain phrases or events in the real world. Learning from Cambridge Analytica, Facebook employed
                    these same tactics on users throughout Australia. Though no significant repercussions were brought
                    against any of the parties involved, it shed light on a serious problem we are facing today. By
                    analyzing your behavior on Facebook, they seek to push information and posts that you will interact
                    with by triggering an emotional response - usually fear or anger. This creates an “echo chamber”
                    where your feed is flooded with propaganda that pertains to your specific political leanings and
                    ideologies, ultimately affecting how you formulate opinions and make decisions. When it comes to
                    hugely important decisions we make like who we want in office in local, state, and the federal
                    government, it’s vital that we have all the information available on the subject that represents all
                    sides of the issue. If we are only given partial information, our opinions are inevitably skewed in
                    one direction, often purposely done by companies like Facebook and the corporations they sell our
                    data to. Most importantly, we have to make sure that the information we are receiving is accurate
                    and true.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sadly, it’s not just Facebook that is collecting and selling our data unbeknownst to us. Instagram,
                    which was bought by Facebook in 2012, is the preferred platform for most young people today and they
                    employ the same algorithms and tactics that Facebook uses. It’s also important to note that
                    WhatsApp, a messaging service, is owned by Facebook as well. Apps like Snapchat utilize facial
                    recognition technology to provide you with fun filters to play with, but that technology is also
                    collecting, storing, and selling that information. Pokemon GO, an augmented reality game that was
                    wildly popular when it was released, analyzes and maps the environment you’re currently in using
                    location services and your smartphone camera. Though it’s technically not a social media platform,
                    if you think they aren’t storing that data, then you haven’t been paying attention. Pokemon GO was
                    actually created by Google and companies paid incredible amounts of money to Google to encourage
                    increased foot traffic in their businesses by luring users via rewards in the game itself. For
                    example, placing a rare Pokemon character to catch within the game inside a physical Starbucks
                    greatly increased the chances of the user entering Starbucks and perhaps buying a cup of coffee.
                    Overall, when you post anything on the internet, remember that it can be accessed by anyone and
                    everyone, so think twice before you post and ask yourself if it’s worth giving up your privacy.
