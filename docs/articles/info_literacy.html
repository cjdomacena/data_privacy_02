                <p>
                    The term “information literacy” refers to the ability of the reader to analyze the information they
                    are reading and determine whether that information is relevant and reliable. Many of us can recall
                    learning about creating “works cited” pages and using proper citations and references for research
                    papers we wrote in school. Turns out, that skill extends far beyond just writing academic papers. In
                    a perfect world, news media sources would all be held accountable for providing accurate and current
                    information. Sadly, this is not the reality we live in. Most news media sources have their own
                    agendas, from pushing products of the corporations who sponsor them to skewing news stories to alter
                    our perceptions of events. A fun way to remember how to evaluate sources, whether it’s printed, on
                    the web, or on TV, is to ask yourself, “Is it CRAP?” The acronym CRAP stands for Currency,
                    Relevance/Reliability, Authority, and Purpose.
                </p>

                <h5>Currency</h5>
                <p>
                    When you read or hear anything that piques your interest, double check when that information was
                    published and if it’s still relevant to the current time or subject. If the information is old, see
                    if it has been revised since its initial publication.
                </p>

                <h5>Relevance and Reliability</h5>
                <p>
                    For whichever topic you are researching or reading about, determine whether the information is truly
                    related to the subject. This includes seeking out information that conflicts with your own personal
                    opinions, as long as it is accurate. Also consider whether the information you are assessing has the
                    appropriate amount of citations in itself to give it reasonable credibility. Sources like Wikipedia
                    are great for brief introductions to subjects, but open source publications are extremely
                    susceptible to bias.
                </p>

                <h5>Authority</h5>
                <p>
                    All published, reliable media sources should always note who the author of the article is. Do some
                    research into the author themself. Ask yourself if the author has the credentials to be writing on
                    the subject, assess their experience with the subject, as well as their own opinion on it. Also,
                    take into account who or what organization published the article. If the author or publisher are
                    sponsored by organizations with strong political leanings, the information may not be as accurate as
                    we’d like it to be.
                </p>

                <h5>Purpose</h5>
                <p>
                    Always be wary of articles that pull on your heart strings or aim to incite strong emotions in the
                    reader. This is a tactic often used by media sources to push you in a certain direction. Be mindful
                    of the intended audience of the publication or broadcast. Also, ask yourself whether the information
                    you’re reading is fact or opinion. There’s nothing wrong with reading opinionated content, but it’s
                    useful to separate this kind of information from factual information. A truly unbiased source’s only
                    purpose is to inform the reader of what actually happened and is supported by fact-based evidence.
                    Overly descriptive language can entice a reader, but be careful not to be fooled by it.
